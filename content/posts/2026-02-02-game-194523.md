In a significant move for the gaming community, Respawn Entertainment has announced that the Nintendo Switch version of Apex Legends will be shutting down this summer, specifically on August 4, 2026. This decision comes as the studio prepares to transition players to the new Nintendo Switch 2, where they can continue their gaming experience without losing their in-game currency. Players are encouraged to either spend their Apex Coins before the shutdown or upgrade to the Switch 2 to retain their balance.

Originally launched in 2019 on PS4, Xbox One, and PC, Apex Legends made its way to the Switch in 2021. The announcement marks the end of an era for Switch players, as Season 29 will be the final update for the game on this platform. While cross-progression is supported across other platforms, players should note that currency earned on the Switch will remain exclusive to that console.

As we look ahead, the transition to the Switch 2 promises to enhance the gaming experience for Apex Legends fans. With Nintendo's investment in the new hardware, players can expect improved performance and a more immersive gameplay experience. Will you be making the switch to the new console, or will you explore other platforms for your Apex Legends fix?
