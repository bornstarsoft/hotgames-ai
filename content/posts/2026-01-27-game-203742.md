In a surprising turn of events, Walmart may have inadvertently revealed two unannounced GameCube titles set to join the Nintendo Switch Online service. The retailer's website showcased a selection of games, including the beloved classics Metroid Prime 2 and Pikmin 2, which have yet to be officially confirmed by Nintendo. While this could be a simple error, it raises exciting possibilities for fans eagerly awaiting new additions to the service.

Currently, the Nintendo Switch Online's GameCube library is exclusive to Switch 2 users, with only eight titles available. Nintendo has teased a few upcoming games, including Super Mario Sunshine and Pokmon XD: Gale of Darkness, but no specific release dates have been provided. The potential inclusion of Metroid Prime 2 and Pikmin 2 would undoubtedly enhance the gaming experience for many players.

As we look ahead, the anticipation for these classic titles grows. Will Nintendo officially confirm this leak, and when can fans expect to dive back into these iconic games? Only time will tell, but the excitement is palpable among the gaming community.
