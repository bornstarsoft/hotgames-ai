A recent revelation from a Monster Hunter Wilds player has sparked discussions about the games performance on PC, particularly in relation to downloadable content (DLC). According to Reddit user de_Tylmarande, the game reportedly runs significantly better when all DLC is installed, with frame rates potentially tripling in certain areas. This unexpected finding suggests that the games performance issues may stem from an aggressive DLC ownership check that negatively impacts gameplay.

The player noticed a stark contrast in performance between their account, which only had the base game, and a friends account that included all DLC. After conducting tests, they concluded that the games frequent checks for DLC presence could be causing severe frame rate drops. By creating a mod that bypasses these checks, they experienced a dramatic improvement in performance, raising questions about the coding practices behind the games DLC management.

This situation highlights a broader concern in the gaming community regarding how DLC can affect game performance. As players await a response from Capcom, the developer, many are left wondering if similar issues could arise in future titles. Will developers take note of this feedback to ensure smoother gaming experiences?
