Team Afternoon is set to release their innovative game, "Don't You Trust Me?" on February 6, 2026, offering players a unique blend of strategy, puzzle, and simulation genres. This free-to-play title invites gamers to step into the shoes of a video editor tasked with creating a "perfect" fake clear video from a failed dungeon raid, all set against a nostalgic Windows 98 backdrop.

The core gameplay revolves around precise timeline editing, where players must analyze enemy attack patterns and arrange clips to craft an action sequence that appears flawless. This intriguing concept not only challenges players' strategic thinking but also offers a satirical narrative that contrasts the chaotic reality of a failed raid with the glorified version presented to the world.

As we look forward to the release, it's exciting to see how this game will resonate with both nostalgic gamers and new players alike. Will you be ready to create your own miracles in "Don't You Trust Me?"?
