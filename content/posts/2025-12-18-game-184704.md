In a shocking turn of events, November 2025 marked the worst month for hardware sales and physical game spending in the US in 30 years. According to Circana, only 1.6 million units of video game hardware were sold, the lowest since 1995, with total hardware spending plummeting to $695 milliona staggering 27% drop from last year. This decline is particularly alarming given that November is typically a peak sales month due to Black Friday and holiday shopping.

The average price for new gaming hardware reached an all-time high of $439, which likely contributed to the decline in sales. The PlayStation 5 emerged as the best-selling console, followed closely by the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S. Meanwhile, physical software spending also took a hit, falling 14% compared to the previous year, marking an all-time low for November since tracking began.

As we look ahead, the question remains: how will console manufacturers respond to these challenges, especially with rising component costs? The gaming landscape is shifting, and it will be interesting to see how companies adapt to maintain their market positions amidst these economic pressures.
