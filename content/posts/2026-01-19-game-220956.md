Exciting news for gamers! The beloved Far Cry 3 Classic Edition is set to receive a significant update that will enhance gameplay on the PS5 and PS5 Pro by introducing a smooth 60 FPS experience. This update, announced by Ubisoft, is a welcome addition for fans of the iconic title originally released in 2012, ensuring that players can enjoy a more fluid gaming experience on current-gen consoles.

The update is scheduled for release on January 21, and while Xbox players have already been enjoying 60 FPS gameplay, PS4 owners have expressed disappointment over the lack of similar updates for their platform. Additionally, the game is available as part of the Far Cry Anthology Bundle on the PlayStation Store, which is currently on sale, making it an excellent time for newcomers to dive into this classic.

As we look forward to the update, it raises questions about how other classic titles might be revitalized for modern consoles. Will we see more updates like this in the future?
