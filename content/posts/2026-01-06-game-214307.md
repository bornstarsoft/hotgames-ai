Sony has recently patented an innovative technology that could change the way players interact with their favorite PlayStation games. The Ghost Player system utilizes AI to create a virtual version of the player character, assisting users when they encounter challenging sections in a game. This feature aims to enhance the gaming experience by providing real-time support, allowing players to either watch the AI solve a puzzle or have it complete the level for them.

Imagine being stuck on a difficult puzzle in an Uncharted game, only to summon an AI-controlled Nathan Drake to demonstrate the solution. This technology builds on the existing PS5 Game Help system, which has already received positive feedback for its convenience. By leveraging AI trained on actual gameplay footage, the Ghost Player promises a more dynamic and engaging way to overcome obstacles, rather than relying on static hints or pre-recorded solutions.

As gaming continues to evolve, the integration of AI-driven features like the Ghost Player could redefine how players approach challenges. Will this technology make gaming more accessible, or will it diminish the sense of achievement that comes from overcoming difficult tasks? Only time will tell.
