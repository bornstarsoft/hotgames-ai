Bungie has officially announced the release date and pricing for its highly anticipated extraction shooter, Marathon. Set to launch in March 2026, the game will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC for a price of $39.99. This announcement comes after a previous delay aimed at refining the game based on player feedback, showcasing Bungie's commitment to delivering a polished experience.

In addition to the release date, Bungie has assured players that Marathon will not feature pay-to-win mechanics, allowing everyone access to gameplay updates and a reward pass that wont expire. This approach is likely to resonate well with the gaming community, especially in an era where monetization strategies are often scrutinized. With new features like proximity chat and a solo experience, Marathon is shaping up to be an exciting addition to Bungie's portfolio.

As we look forward to the game's release, it raises the question: will Marathon redefine the extraction shooter genre? Only time will tell, but the anticipation is certainly building among fans and newcomers alike.
