The recent revelation of a new game in the Divinity series at The Game Awards has taken the gaming world by storm, especially since even major platform holders like PlayStation and Xbox were kept in the dark. Larian Studios' CEO, Swen Vincke, shared that the secrecy surrounding the statue meant to promote the game was so tight that the platforms only learned about it during the event itself. This highlights the studio's commitment to surprise and excitement in the gaming community.

In an exclusive interview, Vincke expressed that Larian has yet to engage in discussions with console manufacturers regarding the new title. The anticipation surrounding the game is palpable, especially after the success of Baldurs Gate 3, which won six awards at the same ceremony. With the tagline, The gods are silent. Rivellon bleeds. New powers stir, fans are eager to see how Larian plans to expand its RPG universe.

As the gaming landscape evolves, the excitement for new titles like this one raises questions about the future of RPGs and how developers will continue to innovate. Will Larian's next installment redefine the genre once again?
