In addition to these major releases, the catalog will also feature Skate Story, a unique indie title that is already available, alongside family-friendly options like Lego Horizon Adventures and two Paw Patrol games. For those who appreciate classic gaming, Soulcalibur III joins the PlayStation Plus Classic Catalog, exclusively for Premium members, offering a nostalgic trip back to the PS2 era.
