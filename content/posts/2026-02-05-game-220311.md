Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa recently addressed concerns regarding the rising costs of memory components and their potential impact on the pricing of the upcoming Switch 2. Despite the ongoing surge in RAM prices, largely driven by demand from AI data centers, Furukawa reassured fans that there are currently no plans to increase the price of the Switch 2.

During a Q&A session following Nintendo's latest financial call, Furukawa emphasized that while the company is monitoring component costs closely, any future price adjustments would consider a variety of factors beyond just profitability. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a stable supply chain and ensuring that the Switch 2 remains accessible to consumers, especially during its crucial second and third years in the market.

As the gaming industry continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how Nintendo navigates these challenges. Will they manage to keep the Switch 2 competitively priced, or will market pressures force them to reconsider? Only time will tell.
